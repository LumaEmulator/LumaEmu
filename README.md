As of EmulatorJS version 4.0, this project is no longer a reverse-engineered version of the emulatorjs.com project. It is now a complete re-write,


README BEFORE YOU UPDATE: EmulatorJS Version 4.0 is a complete re-write of the application. At least some bugs are expected. If you did any communicating with the emulator, there is a 100% chance you will need to re-write your project, and to people with active branches of this project, I wish you luck with merge conflicts (I'm very sorry). The emulator object can be accessed through the window.EJS_emulator object.

It is HIGHLY suggested that you update to 4.0 ASAP.
